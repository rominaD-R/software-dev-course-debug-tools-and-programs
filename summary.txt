I first used the Console in the Firefox Developer tools to see the first error. It was an Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "price", 
cartItems[i] is undefined. So I knew it would be in the loop that called cartItems[i], and the Console also said it was in the calculateTotal
function block.  So I changed for (let i = 0; i <= cartItems.length; i++) to for (let i = 0; i < cartItems.length; i++). That fixed the most
jarring error. 

For edge cases:
    - For an empty cart, I put if (cartItems.length == 0) return `No items in cart.`; to show that the user didn't get anything. I'm 
    not sure if I was supposed to return something else. 
    - For one item in a the cart, the functions worked just fine.
    - I changed it so that if the total argument in the generateReceipt function, I made sure to check that the typeof total was a 
    number. If not, it will give the user a public error message. 
    - The discount being 0 or 1 works fine, IF we're okay with giving 0% and 100% discounts. However, to make it easier, I made the
    discount a global variable instead of being mentioned once in applyDiscount function. I also made another DOM call to show the 
    user what their actual applied discount is. 

I mostly used console.log() statements and read them in the Console in Firefox Developer Tools to help me debug these issues. It was 
very helpful.
